Hi! Here is my final project to be submitted for the class. I'm looking forward to your comments and suggestions. This project was a bit of a mystery as I really wasn't sure if I hit all the requirements. I'm hoping I at least touched on most of them to give you an idea that the class has been a success for me. I also struggled with the specifications not really matching up so I took some "artistic license" and made some adjustments and ended up creating a tablet version as well.
